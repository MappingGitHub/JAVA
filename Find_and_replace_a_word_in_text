the resulting string.

 it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of
 incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was
 the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us,

 direct the other way-- in short, the period was so far like the present period,
